## What is this

I taught myself programming in 2021. I never had a reason to learn or use C. I'm teaching myself it now. This is my (bad) attempt to create a word counter using a hand-rolled hash map and an array list. It's not great, and it has flaws, but I'll probably never touch it. I'm putting it on GitHub so I can look back at it at some point. Or maybe you will have some reason to.
